    "# Customer Retention Strategy for Model Fitness Gyms\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze customer retention and churn patterns at Model Fitness branches across the USA. Our objective is to conduct an in-depth examination of churned customers, identify key trends, and understand the primary reasons behind membership cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights from this analysis will guide the development of a comprehensive customer retention strategy designed to enhance member loyalty and address the increasing churn rates, which have emerged as a significant business concern. This strategy will reinforce our commitment to improving member retention and overall customer satisfaction."
